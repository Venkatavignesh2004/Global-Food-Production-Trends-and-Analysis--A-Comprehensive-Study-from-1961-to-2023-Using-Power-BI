# Global Food Production Trends and Analysis: A Comprehensive Study from 1961 to 2023 Using Power BI
  # Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes global food production trends from 1961 to 2023. It provides insights into the production of key crops and fruits, highlighting trends by year and by country. The interactive dashboards allow users to explore the data and understand historical patterns in global food production.

  # Objectives

- Analyze global trends for major crops (rice, wheat, maize, tea, coffee, fruits).

- Visualize production by year and by country/entity.

- Identify patterns and fluctuations in crop production over time.

- Provide interactive dashboards to support decision-making and research.

   # Key Activities & Visulizations 

1. Sum of Rice Production (tonnes)

2. Sum of Wheat Production (tonnes)
